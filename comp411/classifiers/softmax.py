def softmax_loss_naive(W, X, y, reg, regtype='L2'):
    """
    Softmax loss function, naive implementation (with loops)

    Inputs have dimension D, there are C classes, and we operate on minibatches
    of N examples.

    Inputs:
    - W: A numpy array of shape (D, C) containing weights.
    - X: A numpy array of shape (N, D) containing a minibatch of data.
    - y: A numpy array of shape (N,) containing training labels; y[i] = c means
      that X[i] has label c, where 0 <= c < C.
    - reg: (float) regularization strength
    - regtype: Regularization type: L1 or L2

    Returns a tuple of:
    - loss as single float
    - gradient with respect to weights W; an array of same shape as W
